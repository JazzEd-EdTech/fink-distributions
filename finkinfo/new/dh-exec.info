Description: Scripts to help with executable debhelper files
DescDetail: <<
Debhelper (in compat level 9 and above) allows its config files to be
executable, and uses the output of such scripts as if it was the
content of the config file.
.
To ease and standardize the most common tasks, this package provides
a few solutions to help constructing such executable scripts:
.
 * A way to ease variable substitution, from environment variables or
   dpkg-architecture.
 * Ability to filter files by architecture or build profile, within a
   single debhelper control file.
 * An extension to dh_install and dh_installman, with the ability to
   rename files.
