DescPackaging: <<
	The application is in fact self-contained to a very large degree.
	"mupdf" symlink included for consistency with the man pages.

	dmacks: Build system mixes included and externally supplied
	flavors of several libs, which gives an unreliable build and
	unpredictable result. Use externals exclusively.
