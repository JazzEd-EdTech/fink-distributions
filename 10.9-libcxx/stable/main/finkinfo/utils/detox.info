DescDetail: <<
Detox is a program that renames files to make them easier to work with
under Unix and related operating systems. Spaces and various other
unsafe characters (such as "$") get replaced with "_". ISO 8859-1
(Latin-1) characters can be transliterated to ASCII, as can UTF-8
characters. More details are contained in the detox.1 man page.
