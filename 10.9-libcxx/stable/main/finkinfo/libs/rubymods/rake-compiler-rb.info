DescDetail: <<
rake-compiler is first and foremost a productivity tool for Ruby
developers. It's goal is to make the busy developer's life easier
by simplifying the building and packaging of Ruby extensions by
simplifying code and reducing duplication.

It follows *convention over configuration* by advocating a
standardized build and package structure for both C and Java
based RubyGems.
