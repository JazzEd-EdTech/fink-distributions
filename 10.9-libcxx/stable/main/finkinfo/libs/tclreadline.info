Description: Add readline support to tcl
DescUsage: <<
See the manpage for information about how to set a ~/.tchshrc to run
tclreadline::Loop automatically.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
	Bury .dylib in same lib subdir as .tcl (standard for tcl
	packages) and scrap the .h. If we want to provide a -dev for
	others' use, it would have to be highly versioned %n anyway,
	(per install_name, which we would re-identify as a *public*
	Shlibs) and could provide an unversioned symlink in the
	higher-level directory.

	Patch tclreadlineInit.tcl to introspect rather than inserted
	string (even if we used a different variable) for portability
	and to avoid breakage if the path contained whitespace.

	Clone tclreadline.c logic for use of readline.h vs
	readline/readline.h into configure.ac, where the header needs
	to be read. Why isn't this all using AC_CHECK_HEADERS and
	HAVE_foo_H tokens?
