# Our tests need tox, but tox >= 3.0.0 needs this for its own tests.
# tox is more important, so we only run tests depending on presence of tox.
# Also tests won't run without this package already installed; afterwards 1
# failure with test_standalone_mock not working as expected on Python 3.

DescDetail: <<
This plugin installs a mocker fixture which is a thin-wrapper around the
patching API provided by the mock package, but with the benefit of not
having to worry about undoing patches at the end of a test.
