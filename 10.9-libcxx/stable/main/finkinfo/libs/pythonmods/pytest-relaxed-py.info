Package: pytest-relaxed-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 1.1.2
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7)

Description: Relaxed pytest test discovery/organization
DescDetail: <<
pytest-relaxed provides 'relaxed' test discovery for pytest.
It is the spiritual successor to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spec, but is
built for pytest instead of nosetests, and rethinks some aspects of the design
(such as increased ability to opt-in to various behaviors.)
Rationale
Has it ever felt strange to you that we put our tests in tests/, then name the
files test_foo.py, name the test classes TestFoo, and finally name the test
methods test_foo_bar? Especially when almost all of the code inside of tests/
is, well, tests?
This pytest plugin takes a page from the rest of Python, where you don't have
to explicitly note public module/class members, but only need to hint as to
which ones are private. By default, all files and objects pytest is told to
scan will be considered tests; to mark something as not-a-test, simply prefix
it with an underscore.
<<

DescPackaging: <<
decorator and six are listed as requirements, but builds without them (or pytest...)
Needs pytest <3.3, but is required for testing invoke, which is a new dependency
of pytest >=3.6! Taking the brutal way out and forcing it to live with pytest-3.6.2
produces a couple of test failures, but it works...
`setup.py pytest` is not implemented for Python 3.7 yet.
