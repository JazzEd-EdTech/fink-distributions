Description: Guile-based library for scientific simulation
License: LGPL
DescDetail: <<
libctl is a free Guile-based library implementing flexible 
control files for scientific simulations. 
It was written at MIT to support their Photonic Bands and Meep 
software, but has proven useful in other programs too.
<<
DescUsage: <<
The C++ binding for libctl's Guile commands is incompatible
with clang/libc++, because of the "function" type it introduces.
Programs using libctl therefore should be compiled with Fink's
gccXX compilers. On OSX 10.9, Fink's default g++/libc++ will 
crash with "error: reference to 'function' is ambiguous".
