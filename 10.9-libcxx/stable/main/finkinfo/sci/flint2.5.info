# DISCLAIMER: Max Horn is the sole maintainer of this package.
# Please DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS without informing the maintainer.
# Preferably, send a patch to me instead of making changes yourself!
# If that is not possible due to extra urgency, at least send me a mail.
#
# Explanation: I am sick and tired of getting back to my packages and
# discovering that people have messed with it. I am then forced to
# retrace their steps, find out who, when and why did make a certain
# change etc. -- i.e. it makes my life as maintainer harder.
# Furthermore, as maintainer I am responsible for problems caused by my
# packages. But I am not willing to take responsibility for something I
# did not do. In particular, for changes that other people introduced
# behind my back, no matter how good and noble their intentions were. As
# such, I may see myself forced to drop responsibility for (and hence,
# maintainership of) the affected package.

Description: Library for doing number theory
DescDetail: <<
FLINT is a C library for doing number theory. It supports arithmetic
with numbers, polynomials, power series and matrices over many base
rings, including:

* Multiprecision integers and rationals
* Integers modulo n
* p-adic numbers
* Finite fields (prime and non-prime order)
* Real and complex numbers (via the Arb extension library)
<<
# TODO: Make an -mpir variant?
DescPackaging: <<
 According to the flint authors, the binary interface *should* not
 change between minor relases, but it still *might*. Hence the name of
 this package includes the full MAJOR.MINOR version (but not the
 patchlevel).

 Moreover, the shlibs produced by the flint buildsystem are not
 versioned. Hence we modify it to add a compatibility and current
 version based on MAJOR.MINOR.
 
 Finally, GMP 6 changed the documented behaviour of mpz_invert (yuck)
 so a patch is needed to make things work consistently across GMP
 versions.
