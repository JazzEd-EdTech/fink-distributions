Description: Epics Channel Access for Python
DescDetail: <<
PyEpics is an interface for the Channel Access (CA) library of the Epics
Control System to the Python Programming language.  The pyepics package
provides a base epics module to python, with methods for reading from and
writing to Epics Process Variables (PVs) via the CA protocol.  The package
includes a fairly complete, thin layer over the low-level Channel Access
library in the ca module, and higher-level abstractions built on top of
this basic functionality.
