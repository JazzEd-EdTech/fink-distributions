Library version info and name change inconsistently between major versions.

DescPort: <<
fangism:
Some C++ related patching was necessary to get the source to compile against
g++-4.0, even though upstream requires g++-4.2 or higher.
Also, some POSIX APIs that were expected for atomic operations were 
mapped to darwin8 equivalents.
Additional patching needed to C-cast (ewww...) address-of-unsigned to 
pointer-to-signed because of differences in the atomicity API.

OpenSSL1.1 patch from upstream: 4607bbf78040789dee29266878ce109136b984ef
Except for the is_valid() chunk, as that method wasn't added until a
later libtorrent* version.
